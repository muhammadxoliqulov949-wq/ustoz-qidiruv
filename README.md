# USTOZ — Frontend

Marketplace for finding courses and teachers (Uzbekistan). This repository
implements the approved USTOZ Master Frontend Specification phase by phase:
**Phase 1** foundation (tokens, primitives, header, hero), **Phase 2** the
full homepage, and **Phase 3** browse & search (`/courses` results engine +
`/categories` routes). Detail pages, auth and everything after land in later
phases.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS v4 — design tokens live in CSS (`@theme`), no JS config
- `lucide-react` — single icon library for the whole app
- Self-hosted Inter (`@fontsource-variable/inter`) with system-font fallback

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # dev server (0.0.0.0:3000)
npm run build    # production build (offline-safe: fonts are self-hosted)
npm run lint     # eslint
npx tsc --noEmit # typecheck
```

## Design system (Phase 1)

**Source of truth for styling is `src/app/globals.css`** — every color,
spacing step, radius, shadow, motion and breakpoint is a token there.
Components consume tokens via generated utilities (`bg-accent-600`, `p-lg`,
`rounded-pill`, `shadow-raised`, `duration-fast`); hard-coded values outside
the token file are not allowed.

Key decisions:

- Warm canvas `#F7F7F5`, white surfaces, **deep emerald** (`--color-accent-*`)
  as the single accent.
- Ink text scale (`ink-900 … ink-300`) instead of pure black/gray.
- Spacing = the native 4px numeric grid only (`p-6`, `gap-8`, `pt-18`,
  `pt-26` for section rhythm). Named steps (`--spacing-4xl` …) were removed:
  Tailwind v4 resolves bare `max-w-*`/`min-w-*` suffixes against the spacing
  namespace too, and custom keys there silently hijack `max-w-4xl` etc.
  — caught by real-browser QA (shrink-to-fit text collapsing to ~1 word).
- Breakpoints: `xs 416 / sm 640 / md 768 / lg 1024 / xl 1280`; no `2xl` usage —
  content is capped by the container anyway.
- One focus treatment for everything: `focusRing` in `src/lib/utils.ts`.

## Layout

- `site-container` utility: **1280px** max width, page padding
  20px → 32px (md) → 40px (xl).
- Header is `sticky`; at scroll > 8px it morphs into a subtle blurred
  floating surface (`backdrop-blur` + hairline border + `shadow-md`).
- Mobile/tablet (< lg): simple top header (logo + menu). The menu panel holds
  search, nav links, Kirish and the Ustoz bo‘lish CTA.
  **Bottom navigation is intentionally not built yet** (later mobile phase).

## Component inventory

`src/components/ui/` (import via `@/components/ui`):

| Component | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Button`, `ButtonLink` | 5 variants × 3 sizes, `loading`, icon slots; `ButtonLink` keeps `<Link>` semantics |
| `IconButton` | requires accessible `label`; `onDark` variant for dark surfaces |
| `Input` | labelled field; hint/error slots; exports the shared `fieldBaseClasses` skin |
| `SearchInput` | `md` (header) / `lg` (results pages) / `xl` (hero); form-wrapped, clearable, submit callback |
| `Badge` | soft/solid tones incl. status dot |
| `Avatar` | initials fallback, status dot, 5 sizes |
| `Card`, `CardMedia`, `LinkCard` | default / interactive / quiet; whole-card link for future listing pages |
| `Pill` | one skin, two shapes: `as="button"` (real hidden checkbox, keyboard/screen-reader friendly) and `as="link"` |
| `SectionHeader` | eyebrow/title/description/action opener for every page section |
| `CourseCard` | 16:10 media, save control, stretched-link title; whole card clickable except the heart; focus ring drawn by Card `focus-within` |
| `TeacherCard` | dominant 5:4 photo, identity + trust band, language chips, course count |
| `CategoryCard` | icon tile + name + course count, stretched link |
| `Rating`, `VerifiedMark` | shared card meta: star readout (`--color-rating`) and accessibility-complete verification mark |
| `SaveButton` | `aria-pressed` toggle, z-above stretched link, stops propagation; persistence arrives with the API phase |

App shell: `navigation/header.tsx`, `navigation/logo.tsx`,
`navigation/mobile-menu.tsx`, `layout/footer.tsx` (light 4-group footer),
`layout/section.tsx` (canonical section rhythm).

## Homepage (Phase 2)

`hero → popular-categories → recommended-courses → format-editorial →
top-teachers → how-it-works → trust-promises → teacher-cta → footer`

All sections are server-rendered from the typed mock layer
(`src/data/models.ts` + `categories.ts` / `courses.ts` / `teachers.ts`).
Icons resolve through `src/components/icons.tsx` (data stores string keys →
lucide components; models stay serializable for the future API). Display
numbers/prices format via `src/lib/format.ts` (SSR-deterministic, no Intl).
Card cover photography and teacher portraits are placeholder mock assets in
`public/media/`. The hero quick-filter row and the header/menu searches
navigate into the Phase 3 results engine (URL is the contract).

## Browse & search (Phase 3)

`/courses` (full catalog) and `/categories/[slug]` (same engine, category
locked in the path) compose one `CoursesBrowser`; `/categories` is the tile
index. The **URL is the only state** — `q`, `mode`, `price=free`, `city`,
`sort` are parsed/sanitized by the pure engine in `src/lib/course-search.ts`
(whitelist parsing, default-omitting serialization, apostrophe-insensitive
matching), so every pill/chip/link is server-rendered and shareable. Only
two client islands exist on these pages: the results search field
(`components/courses/courses-search.tsx`) and `url-select.tsx` (native
`<select>` for city/sort that reads/writes one URL param — OS picker on
mobile, no hand-rolled popover). Active facets without a visible pill state
(q, city) get removable chips. Empty → one quiet panel, never fake results.
The mock catalog is 12 courses (`courses.ts` order = “Tavsiya etilgan”);
cities are derived from the data. `notFound()` guards unknown category
slugs; titles/descriptions come from `generateMetadata` per route.

## Conventions

- Server components by default; `"use client"` only where state/events live
  (header, search, pills, save button).
- No per-component styles: compose tokens; new visual values go into
  `globals.css` first.
- Hiding Buttons: use media variants (`max-lg:hidden`), never `hidden` —
  the base `inline-flex` utility outranks plain `hidden` in v4's sort order.
- Navigation data (labels, routes, hero copy) is centralized in
  `src/data/site.ts`.
- Icons: lucide only, never inline SVG.
- Per-link prefetch is declared in nav data (`site.ts`): unbuilt routes set
  `prefetch: false`; built routes omit the flag (e.g. /courses since Phase 3).

## Deliberately deferred

Course/teacher detail pages (`/courses/[slug]`, `/teachers/[slug]`),
teachers browse (`/teachers`), auth (Kirish flow), dashboards, filters
drawer (level/languages/price-range facets), pagination (catalog fits one
page), payment, messaging, save persistence, real API, dark mode
evaluation, i18n (`/uz`, `/ru`…), mobile bottom navigation.
